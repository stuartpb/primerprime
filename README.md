## Computers as I understand them

by Stuart P. Bentley

## Foreword

I'm not sure where I learned the stuff I'm going to write here. I think it
started somewhere around Wikipedia, then spiralled off into perusing the Jargon
File, sprinkled with some loose Googling into long-forgotten 1993 home pages
and archived posts to mailing lists. Raymond Chen's blog,
[The Old New Thing][], contributed a lot to my understanding of the history of
Windows.

There's no real authority to any of this: I wasn't around for pretty much all
of the stuff I'm going to write about. Most of this is me half-remembering
things I read on the Internet somewhere and filling in the gaps with
over-simplistic interpretations and assumptions that fit the narrative I've
arbitrarily constructed.

notice that I've got something rather wrong, you can suggest an edit by

## Introduction

Computers are more of a story than a science. Programming is less about
understanding complex mathematical theories than it is about knowing why people
made the weird decisions that shaped every interaction we have with computers
to this day.

## Chapter 1: Everything Before The Sixties

The first computers ever invented are generally agreed to be Charles Babbage's
Difference Engine and Analytical Engine, mechanical devices designed around the
1840s. Lady Ada Lovelace (daughter of Lord Byron) wrote a sequence of
operations that could be performed using the Analytical Engine, that would be
the first computer program ever.

However, while Babbage's designs for the machines were complete by the time of
Babbage's death in 1871, a working Difference Engine wouldn't be built until
nearly a century later, and a completed, working Analytical Engine, as of June
2013, has never been built. As a result, the widespread influence of these
particular machines that Babbage envisioned never materialized: when the first
computers as we think of them were built around the time of World War II, their
builders did it from scratch, with little to no awareness of how the Analytical
Engine would have worked.

Here are the lessons of this story that are relevant today:

1. The most detailed plans will never be more than a historical footnote if you
   can't carry them out.
2. Just because something's possible with current technology, doesn't mean you
   should *try* it with current technology.
3. Female programmers were here first.

The two most influential developments of the nineteenth century on modern
computers would be much more pedestrian: the typewriter and the telegraph.
